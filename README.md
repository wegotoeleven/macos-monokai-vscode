## Credit

This theme based off the default VSCode Dark and Light themes, with some changes to the activity and title bar colours to make the theme more consistent with macOS light and dark modes. This theme also uses [Monokai](https://web.archive.org/web/20161107090516/http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/) syntax colours, which I've attempted to keep as true to the original as possible.
